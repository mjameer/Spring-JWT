Understanding JWT Authentication: A Key to Modern Web Security üîê

As web developers, we often grapple with secure authentication. JWT (JSON Web Token) offers a robust solution. Here's a quick rundown:

1Ô∏è‚É£ User logs in, server verifies credentials

2Ô∏è‚É£ Server creates a signed JWT with user info and expiration

3Ô∏è‚É£ Client stores and sends JWT with each request

4Ô∏è‚É£ Server verifies JWT signature and extracts user info


Key benefits:
- Stateless: reduces server load
- Scalable: works well with microservices
- Secure: when implemented correctly with HTTPS

Remember: 
- Keep your server's secret key safe
- Set short expiration times
- Consider using refresh tokens
